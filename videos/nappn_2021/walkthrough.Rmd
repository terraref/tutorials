## Data overview - David

The purpose of this walkthrough is to provide an introduction the TERRA REF public domain high throughput phenomics datasets (LeBauer et al 2020), and to give learners a chance to access and explore a representative cross section of these data. 

In addition to this workshop, we have online tutorials for using these data at [https://terraref.github.io/tutorials/](https://terraref.github.io/tutorials/). There are also materials from previous walkthrough workshops at [https://github.com/terraref/tutorials/tree/master/videos](https://github.com/terraref/tutorials/tree/master/videos). We are striving to make these data as accessible and usable as possible. 

TERRA REF is a project funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy (ARPA-E). The objective is to advance the science and technology of high throughput field phenotyping, which is the automated measurement of plant traits. The TERRA REF field scanner is the world’s largest agricultural robot and is capable of collecting data from a range of sensors at 1 mm spatial resolution. You can learn more about the project from the website, [terraref.org](https://terraref.org) and the documentation, [docs.terraref.org](https://docs.terraref.org). The suite of sensors include visible light cameras, hyperspectral cameras, a laser 3d scanner, and environmental data. These are provided alongside a suite of traits collected by hand as well as derived from sensors. Along with these data are high resolution genome sequences for hundreds of varieties of Sorghum being monitored as well as soil, weather, and other environmental data.

### Experimental design - David

(Show picture of site) Field site is in Arizona. Field is passed over by large robot called a gantry. Lot of equipment in hanging box to collect many types of data. 

Gantry goes systematically over entire field once a day. Some sensors take data every day, like 9,000 images from RGB camera. Others more intermittently, like hyperspectral images, because of data space limits. 

Sensors include: 

* camera that takes stereo pairs of red-green-blue images (**Stereo RGB**)
* thermal infrared images (**FLIR**)
* hyperspectral images of over 1000 wavelengths at 2/3 (VNIR) or 12 (SWIR) nm spectral resolution (**VNIR/SWIR**)
* laser that produces a depth map image that is converted to 3D point clouds (**3D Laser**)
* time series of 100 images capturing plant fluorescence response (**PS II Fluor**)
* other data, including environmental data such as temperature and light

Collecting data since 2015, and are up to 8 seasons worth in that time. Originally for sorghum, but now open to other crop species and organizations that want to use system.

### Traitvis webapp - David

The easiest way to start to visualize and understand the TERRA REF data is through the Traitvis shiny app website. Go to [terraref.org/traitvis/](https://terraref.org/traitvis/); this takes a minute to load because there is so much data, and _may freeze if everyone does it at once_! It displays time plots of trait data as well as maps and thumbnails of field scans.

As example, we’ll look at data from Season 6, which we looked at last week, by going to “MAC Season 6” tab.

Can choose different variables and cultivars. Select “Canopy Cover” from first dropdown and second dropdown to “PI656026” to look at cultivar from last time. How much ground is covered increases across year with max at 100. Hover over parts of graph to get specific values.

Change second dropdown to “None” to get all cultivars. Select “Map” tab to look at data spatially. Shows long field in Maricopa, Arizona.

Field is split up into plots. Referenced using range by column system, can see by hovering over map. 

Can choose data within season with slider bar. Set to July 25, or 2018-07-25. Takes a moment to pull data for that date. 

Currently shows canopy cover value for each plot. See for single plot "Range 20 Column 1". Zoom in on lower left hand part. Hover over that and see a canopy cover value of ~18%. 

These data are summarized from camera data, can see that by unselecting "Heat Map" button on left. These are downscaled versions of infrared data. Main image data are infrared and RGB. 

### Dryad data - Kristina

There is a lot of data available from TERRA REF. One of the easier entry points to using the data are on the data repository Dryad. This contains documentation about data, derived trait data, weather data, and information about the sensor and genomic data. This is currently only for two seasons of data. 

Let's look at what's in Dryad download by navigating in file system to folder with Dryad data. 

**README** Best place to start is with the README called `README_terraref_dryad.pdf`. It's a short but detailed document about the entire project, with specific references to what's in this Dryad download. Particularly useful plot on page 8, which shows the different types of data collected and the time periods they were collected. 

**Code folder** This contains everything needed to produce content in this folder, from the data stored on our database Bety. 

**Metadata folder** Additional metadata in the metadata folder about sensors and genomic data. Subfolder also has two sources of weather data, which we'll work with later. 

**Traits folder** Traits folder has trait data for two seasons. Trait data were derived from sensor data or collected manually. There's is one csv per type and method of data. Naming convention here is `season_variable_method.csv`. We'll also work in R with some of these in a bit. 

**Sensors folder** Lastly is the sensor folder, which has some machine readable metadata about the sensor data, which we'll explore as a jumping off point to actually downloading and looking at some data. 

## Sensor data - Kristina

### Metadata - Kristina

Navigate into `sensors/season_6_catalog`. Can see folders for each of the types of sensor data. In `rgb_geotiff_plots`, there are a bunch of json files. These are formatted nicely for computers to understand, but aren't always easy to read ourselves. 

Open up first file `file_catalog_season6_rgb_geotiff_plots_2018-04-16.json`. Lots of info available, but we'll use data after first instance of `path`. This is a file path, help us locate this file on Globus. Path is `season-6/sites/ua-mac/Level_1_Plots/rgb_geotiff/2018-04-16/MAC Field Scanner Season 6 Range 44 Column 7/rgb_geotiff_L1_ua-mac_2018-04-16__10-17-18-788_left.tif`. 

### Download from Globus - Kristina

[out of date instructions](https://docs.terraref.org/user-manual/how-to-access-data/)

Now we have to set up Globus to be able to download data from TERRA REF to our computer. Data on Globus is transferred between endpoints. Need one endpoint for our computer and the endpoint for the data source. 

Go to globus.org and sign into account. Go to Endpoints in left hand side menu and click on "Administered By You" tab. After following automated setup for Globus download, should have a local endpoint listed here. 

(Optional possible step: Create personal endpoint by opening up Globus Connect, go to Preferences, to Access, click + button, select local folder (maybe Desktop for now), select "Writable" tab)

We'll need to add the TERRA REF endpoint. In "Search all endpoints" bar in upper right, type in #Terraref. Add endpoint that pops up by clicking on it. TODO: ask if Jessica can test this

Transfer that RGB image from TERRA REF endpoint to our endpoint. Click on File Manager. In left side "Collection" bar, select personal endpoint. In right side "Collection" bar, select TERRA REF endpoint. 

In right hand file system, navigate to `/ua-mac/Level_1_Plots/rgb_geotiff/2018-04-16/MAC Field Scanner Season 6 Range 44 Column 7/`. Can specify local path too. Transfer to local Globus endpoint in same root folder as Dryad data by submitting transfer. Can see job by clicking "View details" link in green pop up box. Show file locally. 

### Plot - Kristina

R has a pretty good set of tools for working with spatial data. One of these is `raster` package, which is good for gridded data like this RGB image. 

```{r}
library(raster)
single_RGB <- raster("rgb_geotiff_L1_ua-mac_2018-04-16__10-17-18-788_left.tif 06-09-33-030.tif")
plot(single_RGB)
```

TODO: add clipping? 

There's a lot of other sensor data that was collected and can be accessed in a similar way. 

## Trait data - Kristina

Other available data and tools in Dryad download, including code and instructions for how to generate the data here from the database Bety, high resolution field scanner weather data, and metadata for sensor data and genomics data. 

### Read in data - Kristina

Go back to trait data in Dryad download. The way each csv is structured is there is a row per date, location, cultivar, and trait. We'll look at canopy cover, which is derived from RGB images, for that. Walk through columns, noting that `mean` is the actual value. 

```{r}
canopy_cover <- read.csv("dryad_data/traits/season_6_traits/season_6_canopy_cover_sensor.csv")
str(canopy_cover)
```

Note that date is a factor. We'll need it to be in date format for plotting. Using common package for data exploration and cleaning. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
canopy_cover <- canopy_cover %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))
```

### Plot data - Kristina

Plot data as time series. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = canopy_cover, aes(x = date, y = mean)) +
  geom_point()
```

That's a lot of data, so look at just one cultivar. Get this from the traitvis cultivar menu. 

```{r}
cultivar <- "PI656026"
canopy_cover_cultivar <- canopy_cover %>% 
  filter(genotype == cultivar)

ggplot(data = canopy_cover_cultivar, aes(x = date, y = mean, color = plot)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Weather data - Kristina

### Read in data - Kristina

Weather data in Dryad download for the field site and the two years that the two seasons were collected. Navigate to `metadata/weather/`, we'll be using the `azmet` data. There are csv files for 2017 and 2018, and daily and hourly data. Want to get data for the right year to correspond to canopy cover data, cause we'll combine them later. 

```{r}
range(canopy_cover$date)
```

So 2018 data, and we'll use hourly because we'll need sub-daily values later. 

```{r}
weather <- read.csv("dryad_data/metadata/weather/azmet/azmet_2018_hourly.csv")
```

There are no column names. These are in README in `azmet` folder. In "HOURLY FILES" section. 

Calculate date from year and day of year, to go with date in canopy cover. Then calculate mean temperature. Pull out just date and temperature column. Use dplyr tools to get mean daily temp. 

```{r}
temp_2018_daily <- weather %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(X1, origin = "2017-12-31")) %>% 
  select(date, X4.4) %>% 
  rename(temperature = X4.4) %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarize(mean_temp = mean(temperature))
```

### Plot data - Kristina

```{r}
ggplot(temp_2018_daily, aes(x = date, y = mean_temp)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Calculations and modelling - Kristina

### Calculate GDD - Kristina

We’ll calculate a metric from temperature called growing degree days. Basically a simple measure of how much heat plants have been exposed to over time during the year. Affects a lot of plant physiological processes like flowering. 

Go back a few steps to get hourly temperature values. The value actually needed for GDD is the mean of lowest and highest temps, so add that calculation in as a new column.
```{r}
temp_for_gdd <- weather %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(X1, origin = "2017-12-31")) %>% 
  select(date, X4.4) %>% 
  rename(temperature = X4.4) %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarize(min_temp = min(temperature), 
            max_temp = max(temperature), 
            avg_temp = (max_temp + min_temp) / 2)
```

GDD is measure of the accumulation of heat over time that a plant is exposed to, but only above a chosen base temperature. The amount of heat a plant is exposed to affects timing and ability to grow, produce flowers, ect.

Set a base temp as 10, then combine with average temp to get GDD.

Use an ifelse to set that up. If the mean temp is above the base temp, then take mean temp and subtract base temp of 10 to indicate degrees of heat they’re exposed to that day. Anything below base temp gets no degrees.

```{r}
base_temp <- 10
gdd <- temp_for_gdd %>% 
  mutate(gdd = ifelse(avg_temp > base_temp, avg_temp - base_temp, 0))
```

This is amount of heat each day they’re exposed to. We want to know total amount they’ve been exposed to over the year. Use built-in cumsum to add each day’s degrees onto total.

```{r}
gdd <- temp_for_gdd %>% 
  mutate(gdd = ifelse(avg_temp > base_temp, avg_temp - base_temp, 0), 
         gdd_cum = cumsum(gdd)) %>% 
  select(date, gdd_cum)
```

Plot to see what that looks like. 

```{r}
ggplot(gdd, aes(x = date, y = gdd_cum)) +
  geom_line()
```

### Combine and model trait and weather data - Kristina

We're going to put these gdd calculations with canopy cover for one cultivar and model the relationship between them. 

```{r}
cover_gdd <- left_join(canopy_cover_cultivar, gdd, by = "date") %>% 
  select(date, mean, gdd_cum)
```

Before modeling any data, should look at it. With more heat, cover increases quite quickly before asymptoting.

```{r}
ggplot(cover_gdd, aes(x = gdd_cum, y = mean)) +
  geom_point()
```

Seems like logistic growth model would be a good fit to these data. Wrote a function to model these data. Copy and paste function and point out parts.

```{r}
model_logistic_growth <- function(data){
  #parameter estimates
  c <- 90
  a <- 0.1
  y <- cover_gdd$mean[3]
  g <- cover_gdd$gdd_cum[3]
  b <- ((log((c/y) - 1)) - a)/g
  #model
  model <- nls(mean ~ c / (1 + exp(a + b * gdd_cum)), 
                             start = list(c = c, a = a, b = b),
                             data = data)
  #model coefficients
  single_c <- coef(model)[1]
  single_a <- coef(model)[2]
  single_b <- coef(model)[3]
  #canopy value predictions
  mean_predict = single_c / (1 + exp(single_a + single_b * data$gdd_cum))
  return(mean_predict)
}
```

Run the logistic model on the dataframe to get out predicted values of canopy cover for all GDD values. Add this to dataframe.

```{r}
cover_gdd$predictions <- model_logistic_growth(cover_gdd)
```

Plot the data like before, and plot model as line using predicted values to compare. Looks like a good fit.

```{r}
ggplot(cover_gdd) +
  geom_point(aes(x = gdd_cum, y = mean)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = gdd_cum, y = predictions), color = "orange") +
  labs(x = "Cumulative growing degree days", y = "Canopy Height")
```
