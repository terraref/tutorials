# Overview

This book is intended to provide you with an introduction to the wide range of phenomics datasets generated by the TERRA Reference program. Not only does TERRA REF have a large number of data sets, but many of the databases can be accessed in a number of different ways. While this makes it more complicated to learn, the goal is to provide users with the flexibility to access data in the most useful way.

## Ways of Acessing Data

* Web Interfaces
* Files
* Programming APIs
* API Clients

## Other Resources

The TERRA REF website: terraref.org
The TERRA REF Technical Documentation

## Pre-requisites

While we assume that readers will have some familiarity with the nature of the problem - remote sensing of crop plants - for the most part, these tutorials assume that the user will bring their own scientific questions and a sense of curiosity and are eager to learn. 

Some of the lessons only require a web browser; others will assume familarity with programming at the command line in (typically only one of) Python, R, and / or SQL. You should be willing to find help (see finding help, below).

## Technical Requirements

## Finding help
