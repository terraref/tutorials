# Overview

This book is intended to introduce users to TERRA REF data as quickly as possible. 

It introduces to the wide range of phenomics datasets generated by the TERRA Reference program. Not only does TERRA REF have a large number of data sets, but many of the databases can be accessed in a number of different ways. While this makes it more complicated to learn, the goal is to provide users with the flexibility to access data in the most useful way.

## Pre-requisites

While we assume that readers will have some familiarity with the nature of the problem - remote sensing of crop plants - for the most part, these tutorials assume that the user will bring their own scientific questions and a sense of curiosity and are eager to learn. 

Some of the lessons only require a web browser; others will assume familarity with programming at the command line in (typically only one of) Python, R, and / or SQL. You should be willing to find help (see finding help, below).

## Technical Requirements

At a minimum, you should have:

* An internet connection
* Web Browser
* A TERRA REF Beta User account
  * If you have not done so, please sign up at terraref.org/beta
* Access to the data that you are using
  * The tutorials will state which databases you will need access to
* Software:
  * Software requirements vary with the tutorials, and may be complex
  * 

## Finding help

* Slack
* GitHub
* Google
