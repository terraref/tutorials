# Tutorials


## An introduction to the use of TERRA REF data and software

This repository provides a set of tutorials that are divided by data types and use cases.

In the repository, you will find folders that contain examples of how to access data. 
Within each folder there are both R markdown and Jupyter notebooks.

_If you are **interested in learning how to use the TERRA REF data**_, please find these tutorials published in book form at [terraref.org/tutorials](https://terraref.org/tutorials).

If you want to **fix, improve, or contribute new tutorials**, please continue reading here!

This is a work in progress, and an open source community that welcomes contributions in many forms. Please feel welcome to ask questions, provide suggestions or share analyses that may be of interest to others.


## Contributing

While you can run many of these tutorials locally, many require access to the TERRA REF filesystem and databases. These are available on a web-based cloud development environment that provides Rstudio, Jupyter Notebooks, and other interfaces. Therefore, the _only technical requirements_ are:

* Web browser
* Internet connection

In addition, you will need to:

* Sign up as as a TERRA REF [Beta User by filling out this application](http://terraref.org/beta).
* Sign up for an account on the [TERRA REF Workbench](https://www.workbench.terraref.org), and wait for approval.

### Using the Workbench

The Workbench uses the National Data Service Labs Workbench (NDS Labs Workbench) software. The Workbench is a cloud analysis environment that minimizes and standardizes the software requirements so users can get started quickly. It also provides access to large files and databases that would otherwise be slow and impractical for users to download and store. 

Although we provide a few pre-configured computing environments, Workbench is designed to support any Docker container - that is, anything you can install on a linux computer can be used in the workbench - for an idea of what is possible, see the large number of options on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/explore/).

**To get started**, follow the [Workbench Quick Start](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/terraref/tutorials/blob/master/workbench/ndslabs_workbench_intro.html).

This will walk you through the process of getting started with the first tutorials on how to access data.
