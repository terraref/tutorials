## On workbench

On the TERRA REF Workbench, you have access to the database. These connnections will only work if you are on the workbench.


## Using PostgresSQL Studio


Lets connect to the terraref instance of betydb. Until now we have been accessing betydb.org. Now we will access (a copy of) the database behind `terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/bety`

This connection is only available on the local *ncsa.illinois.edu network, and can be accessed through the NDS Labs workbench.
